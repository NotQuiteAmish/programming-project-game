-------- Caleb's Python Project ----------

- Project 1 - November 7, 2019 -

Hello there, welcome to my project! I'm not entirely sure what my endgoal with this project is, but currently I am
working with the python library "pymunk". It is a physics engine that integrates well with pygame. It takes care of
collisions between objects, and it will also calculate any movement that I cause using forces and impulses.

The first project I made with this library is "bouncinginspace.py". It was made almost entirely from scratch, however
some barebones code snippets were taken from the pymunk example program "pymunkarrows.py". I included this in the
repository as a citation of sorts, but none of it is my original code.

bouncinginspace.py is a program that simulates several bodies floating in space. You can input force by clicking to send a
ball crashing into the planets. However, there is also additionally an option to enable gravity. The gravity code was
written entirely by me. Essentially, the code will loop through all of the objects on the screen and calculate the
gravitational interaction between them, and apply forces accordingly. The gravity can be turned up or down using the
arrow keys, or turned off entirely using the space bar.

Overall, I am very satisfied with how this turned out! I spent about 2 hours interacting with the example program to
familiarize myself with the library, and about 5 hours coding the program itself, as well as an hour or so on other aspects
of the program, such as setting up git to interact with GitHub, or downloading and creating assets for the program.
